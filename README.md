# Novel Ideas
Novel Ideas is a Ruby on Rails app made for Flatiron bootcamp. This is my third overall project.
This project will allow you to create a bookshelf. You can then add books to your bookshelf. You can
add them through search, looking at others' books and there is a top 100 page you can add from.
There is also a forum people can chat on or add book reviews, etc.

## Usage
To use this app, just clone, run bundle, rails db:migrate, rails db:seed and then rails s.

## Contributing
Since this is a school project, contributions are not allowed at this time.
